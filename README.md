This repository contains the low-level software for the TX and RX microcontrollers, the generic radio bootloader firmware and the PC software to interact with the bootloader.

Channel frequency and packet encrypting has been changed for safety reasons.

Pretty old code btw, may contain giant files that ought to be refactored.
